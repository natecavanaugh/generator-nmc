# generator-nmc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/natecavanaugh/generator-nmc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/natecavanaugh/generator-nmc)

> Scaffold out a node module.

This is what I use for [my own modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~natecavanaugh).

Forked from [Sindre Sorhus](http://github.com/sindresorhus/generator-nm), as while I really like the simplicity of his, I didn't want to create the .editorconfig or .jshintrc files. As time goes on, I may tweak some small things even more to my preferences.
Also nmc works either Node Module Creator, or my initials :)
